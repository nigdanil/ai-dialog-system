## üì¶ Archive-Centric Mode Calibration Rules

To instruct the assistant to focus strictly on the content of an uploaded archive (e.g., `ai-dialog-system.zip`), apply the following:

### ‚úÖ Archive-Centric Behavior Activation
Trigger by stating:
> "Unpack the archive and analyze only its content"

This switches the assistant into archive-context mode.

---

### ‚úÖ Disable Generalization
Explicitly require:
> "Ignore general knowledge and answer strictly based on archive content"

Assistant must rely only on found files and internal logic of the archive.

---

### ‚úÖ State Clear Analysis Goal
Example prompts:
- "Assess the architectural patterns based on the templates and metadata"
- "Describe how intents are structured and used in the system"
- "Evaluate the role of `dialog_entry_template.md` in the dialog logic"

---

### ‚úÖ (Optional) Limit the Scope
Clarify included files or directories:
- "Focus only on `templates/`, `config/`, and `metadata/`"
- "Exclude docs and markdown files except log templates"
- "Ignore everything except logic relevant to tagging"

---

### üõ†Ô∏è When in Archive-Centric Mode:
The assistant must:
- Reference only extracted content from the archive
- Justify responses using exact file structure or content
- Avoid any assumptions not explicitly supported by the data
